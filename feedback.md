1.	In the formative task, I did not pay attention to the type of variables, which brought me so much grammar mistakes when I de-bug. Now in the summative portfolio, I carefully checked the codes when defining the variables.
2.	In the formative task, I did not write more systematic codes, and this led to confusion in my thinking and pointless reprogramming. My improvement method is to use more class and DEF functions to clarify the program thinking, and use more while and for to write loops, and finally put in variables to efficiently program.
3.	In the formative task, I always run the program and show errors but can't find the cause. In order to solve this problem, I print the result in the function part in the middle to analyze whether each part of the code is correct.
